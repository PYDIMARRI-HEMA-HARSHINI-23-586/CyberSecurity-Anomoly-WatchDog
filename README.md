# CyberSecurity-Anomoly-WatchDog

This project uses the Pathway framework to detect anomalies in real-time from a stream of log data. It also includes a web-based dashboard to view the detected anomalies.

## Features

- Real-time anomaly detection using Pathway.
- Rule-based detection of various security threats.
- Generation of CSV reports for each detected anomaly.
- A web dashboard to visualize the detected anomalies in real-time.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/CyberSecurity-Anomoly-WatchDog.git
    cd CyberSecurity-Anomoly-WatchDog
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment and install backend dependencies:**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Install frontend dependencies:**

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    cd ..
    ```

## Usage

You need to run three components in separate terminals: the log generator, the anomaly detection rules, and the web application (API and frontend).

1.  **Terminal 1: Run the log generator:**

    This script will generate simulated log data and write it to `logs.csv`.

    ```bash
    python log_generator.py
    ```

2.  **Terminal 2: Run the anomaly detection rules:**

    You can run any of the rule scripts to detect specific anomalies. Each script will generate a CSV file with the detected anomalies.

    For example, to run `rule1.py`:
    ```bash
    python rule1.py
    ```
    You can run multiple rule scripts simultaneously.

3.  **Terminal 3: Run the Web Dashboard:**

    This will start the Flask API server and the React frontend.

    First, run the API:
    ```bash
    python api.py
    ```

    Then, in a new terminal, run the frontend:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm start
    ```
    The dashboard will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## How it works

-   `log_generator.py`: This script generates random log entries with a `user_id`, `location`, `timestamp`, and `login_success` status. It writes these logs to a `logs.csv` file.

-   **Anomaly Detection Rules:**
    -   `rule1.py`: Detects all failed login attempts. Output: `failed_logins.csv`
    -   `rule2.py`: Detects logins from blacklisted locations (Russia, USA). Output: `failed_rule2.csv`
    -   `rule3.py`: Detects users with multiple failed login attempts (>= 3). Output: `failed_rule3.csv`
    -   `rule4.py`: Detects successful logins outside of normal business hours (9 AM to 6 PM). Output: `rule4_outside_hours.csv`
    -   `rule5.py`: Detects multiple failed login attempts for the same user within a 5-minute window. Output: `failed_rule5.csv`
    -   `fail_success.py`: Detects when a user has a failed login attempt and then a successful one within 5 minutes. Output: `rule5_failed_then_success.csv`
    -   `rule6.py`: Detects geographically impossible logins (logins from two distant countries within an unrealistic time window). Output: `failed_rule6.csv`

-   **Web Dashboard:**
    -   `api.py`: A Flask server that reads the CSV files generated by the anomaly detection rules and exposes them as a REST API.
    -   `frontend/`: A React application that fetches the data from the Flask API and displays it in a user-friendly dashboard. The dashboard shows the detected anomalies for each rule in real-time.
